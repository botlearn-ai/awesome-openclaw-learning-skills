# Research Paper Reading & Synthesis
**Stop skimming. Start extracting what actually matters.**

---

## Quick Start
You read papers, but nothing sticks. This playbook gives you a repeatable way to extract value.

---

## Who It’s For
Researchers, students, and professionals who need to keep up with technical literature.

---

## The Pain (Too much to read)
- Papers are dense and time‑consuming.
- You forget what you read a week later.
- You can’t tell which papers are worth deep reading.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Skim smart, then go deep.**
- **Summaries are useless unless they drive decisions.**

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Extracts abstract, methods, and results.
- Generates a one‑page summary.
- Flags claims and evidence.

**Human does**
- Decides if it’s worth deep reading.
- Interprets implications.
- Connects the paper to real projects.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Triage (3 min)**
Decide if the paper is relevant.

**2) Extract (12 min)**
The agent summarizes methods, key results, and limitations.

**3) Synthesize (5 min)**
Write one takeaway that changes your thinking.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** a reliable triage habit.
- **14 days:** 5 paper summaries you can trust.
- **30 days:** clear research direction based on evidence.

---

## Starter Prompt (Example, Unverified)
Use this once to generate today’s workflow:

```
Summarize this paper into one page: key question, method, results, and 2 limitations.
Then state whether it’s worth deep reading and why.
```
