# Personal Knowledge System: Stop Losing What You Learn
**Turn information overload into a simple, usable learning system.**

---

## Quick Start
You read a lot, save a lot, and still forget most of it. This playbook makes learning stick.

---

## Who It’s For
Professionals and students who consume lots of information and want a clean system for recall and reuse.

---

## The Pain (Notes don’t compound)
- Notes are messy and never reused.
- You don’t know what matters until it’s too late.
- You can’t find your best ideas when you need them.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Capture less, connect more.**
- **Build retrieval, not storage.**

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Captures and tags sources.
- Summarizes and formats notes.
- Surfaces weekly review prompts.

**Human does**
- Decides what matters.
- Writes the final insight.
- Builds connections between notes.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Capture (5 min)**
Save 1–2 meaningful ideas from today’s reading.

**2) Connect (10 min)**
Link the idea to one existing note or project.

**3) Output (5 min)**
Write a short summary you can reuse later.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** a clean daily capture habit.
- **14 days:** connected notes you can search and reuse.
- **30 days:** a working knowledge base you trust.

---

## Starter Prompt (Example, Unverified)
Use this once to generate today’s workflow:

```
From today’s reading notes, extract 3 reusable knowledge cards.
For each: title, one‑sentence summary, and 2 tags.
```
