# Exam Prep Fast Track: Beat the Countdown
**A 20‑minute daily system to hit your target score without drowning.**

---

## Quick Start
You don’t have time for another 300‑hour course. You just need to pass—fast. This playbook is for that.

---

## Who It’s For
Learners preparing for a high‑stakes exam with a deadline (IELTS, TOEFL, certifications, entrance tests).

---

## The Pain (No clear study ROI)
- You don’t know what to study each day.
- You waste time on low‑impact topics.
- You feel anxious because progress is unclear.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Focus on high‑yield tasks:** 80% of points come from 20% of skills.
- **Short feedback loops:** Daily practice + correction beats long sessions.

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Builds a daily study plan.
- Generates timed practice and error analysis.
- Tracks weaknesses and adjusts focus.

**Human does**
- Commits to daily practice.
- Chooses what to double down on.
- Fixes habits that cause recurring mistakes.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Daily Target (3 min)**
Pick one exam skill for today (e.g., listening inference, reading speed, essay structure).

**2) Timed Drill (12 min)**
Do a short, timed task. The agent scores it and identifies the top 1–2 errors.

**3) Fix & Repeat (5 min)**
Rewrite or retry using the feedback. Save the correction rule.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** measurable improvement in 1 exam section.
- **14 days:** stable accuracy gains in 2 sections.
- **30 days:** reach target score range with confidence.

---

## Starter Prompt (Example, Unverified)
Use this once to generate today’s workflow:

```
Create a 12‑minute high‑yield practice for IELTS Reading.
Include: one short passage, 5 questions, answer key, and 2 top error patterns to watch.
```
