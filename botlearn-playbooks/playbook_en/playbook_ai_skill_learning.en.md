# AI Skill Learning: From Zero to Real Output
**Learn AI by building one small thing that actually works.**

---

## Quick Start
You watch AI tutorials, but you still can’t build anything. This playbook turns learning into output.

---

## Who It’s For
Professionals and creators who want AI skills that show up in real work (prompting, automation, agents).

---

## The Pain (Tutorials without output)
- You consume content but don’t produce results.
- You don’t know what project to build first.
- You lack a repeatable learning loop.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Project‑based learning:** Skills stick when you ship something.
- **Micro‑feedback loops:** Small iterations beat big vague plans.

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Breaks a project into small tasks.
- Finds examples and suggests tooling.
- Reviews outputs and proposes fixes.

**Human does**
- Chooses the project scope.
- Makes key product decisions.
- Polishes the final output.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Scope (3 min)**
Pick one micro‑project (e.g., summarize emails, create a Q&A bot, automate research notes).

**2) Build (12 min)**
Follow the agent’s step‑by‑step tasks and produce a working version.

**3) Ship (5 min)**
Save the output and write one improvement for tomorrow.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** one working AI mini‑tool.
- **14 days:** a repeatable build workflow.
- **30 days:** 2–3 AI projects you can showcase.

---

## Starter Prompt (Example, Unverified)
Use this once to generate today’s workflow:

```
Break down this AI mini‑project into 3 executable steps: 
Project: auto‑summarize meeting notes into 5 action items.
Give step 1 in detail.
```
