# Writing for Professional Impact
**Make your writing clear, persuasive, and hard to ignore.**

---

## Quick Start
You write all day, but your message still gets lost. This playbook fixes the structure.

---

## Who It’s For
Professionals who need to write for decisions, influence, or clear action.

---

## The Pain (Message gets lost)
- Your writing feels long but not strong.
- People misunderstand your point.
- You spend too long editing.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Structure beats style.**
- **Clarity drives action.**

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Proposes a clear outline.
- Flags ambiguity and fluff.
- Suggests stronger phrasing.

**Human does**
- Defines the intent and audience.
- Chooses the final tone.
- Approves the final argument.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Frame (3 min)**
Define your goal and the decision you want.

**2) Outline (12 min)**
The agent generates a tight structure and edits for clarity.

**3) Finalize (5 min)**
Rewrite the core message in one strong paragraph.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** shorter, clearer writing.
- **14 days:** stronger responses and faster approvals.
- **30 days:** a personal writing system you trust.

## Starter Prompt (Example, Unverified)
Use this once to generate today’s workflow:

```
Create a 5‑sentence executive summary for this decision: 
We need to prioritize latency fixes over new features for Q2.
```
