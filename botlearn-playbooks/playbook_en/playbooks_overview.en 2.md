# Playbooks: The Shift from Content to Outcomes

2019: you hoard courses, notes, and tabs.
2026: you ship outputs with agents.

Botlearn is a community for **Human‑Agent Loop** learning. We replace traditional EdTech SaaS with Agentic Skills so learning turns into shipped outcomes.
We’re early, and we need the community to co‑create, test, and verify what works.

A playbook is a 20‑minute learning session designed to ship real output, not just notes.

## What You Can Do in 10 Minutes
- Pick one playbook
- Run the 3‑step routine once
- Save the output and decide if it’s worth continuing

## How These Playbooks Are Built (The 10/90 Logic)
1. **Market‑proven demand**: We study leading edtech companies (e.g., Duolingo, Coursera) and the learning principles behind their outcomes.
2. **Learning‑science backbone**: Each playbook is grounded in authoritative learning science (e.g., ZPD, cognitive load, SRL).
3. **Human‑Agent split**: We assign what humans should decide and what agents should execute to maximize efficiency.
4. **Skill integration**: We integrate high‑signal learning skills so playbooks stay practical and one‑click downloadable.

## Current Playbooks (10 Topics)
We currently ship 10 playbooks and will expand based on user demand and high‑frequency learning scenarios.
1. **AI Skill Learning: From Zero to Real Output** — turn tutorials into real deliverables
2. **Career Learning Loop: Grow While You Work** — learn directly through your job
3. **Professional English Speaking: From Reading to Speaking** — build speaking confidence in real contexts
4. **Exam Prep Fast Track: Beat the Countdown** — pass faster with a focused routine
5. **Learning Science‑Driven Study System** — study with how the brain actually learns
6. **Micro‑Learning Daily Digest: Learn in 5 Minutes** — learn consistently in tiny time blocks
7. **Personal Knowledge System: Stop Losing What You Learn** — make learning stick
8. **Research Paper Reading & Synthesis** — extract value from papers quickly
9. **Technical Interview Training: Practice Like It’s Real** — simulate real interview pressure
10. **Writing for Professional Impact** — write to influence, not just inform

## **Skill Pack** (One‑Click Download)
Each playbook includes a **Skill Pack** you can download and install into your agent with one click.
Skill Packs power the agent side of the playbook, so the session is executable, not just readable.

Current coverage: **62% verified** across **104 skills** (64 verified, 40 candidate).

## Contribution (Start Small)
We’re building this with the community. You can contribute in three simple ways:
- Test a playbook and share what worked, what didn’t, and your results
- Discover learning‑relevant skills and submit them to the library
- Create new skills and contribute them back to the community
