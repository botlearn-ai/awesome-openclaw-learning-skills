# Micro‑Learning Daily Digest: Learn in 5 Minutes
**A tiny daily routine that compounds without burning you out.**

---

## Quick Start
You don’t need more time. You need a system that works in the time you already have.

---

## Who It’s For
Busy professionals who want steady learning progress without long study sessions.

---

## The Pain (No time to learn)
- You want to learn, but you’re always busy.
- Big courses feel impossible to start.
- You forget what you learned yesterday.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Tiny daily effort beats occasional big effort.**
- **Consistency creates momentum.**

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Generates a daily 5‑minute lesson.
- Sends a micro‑quiz or prompt.
- Tracks streaks and adjustments.

**Human does**
- Shows up daily.
- Answers the prompt.
- Reflects on one takeaway.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (5–10 min/day)
**1) Read (2 min)**
Consume a small piece of high‑signal content.

**2) Respond (5 min)**
Answer a quick question or mini‑quiz.

**3) Save (2 min)**
Write one sentence you want to remember.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** a consistent learning streak.
- **14 days:** noticeable recall improvement.
- **30 days:** one new usable skill or concept.
