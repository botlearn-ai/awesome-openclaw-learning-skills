## What We Accept
- Clearer steps or better examples
- New or improved learning workflows
- Real downloadable skills (link + repo)
- Test results (what you tried, for how long, and the outcome)

---

## Evidence & Verification
We track every playbook with a simple status:
- **UNTESTED**: Not yet validated by humans
- **TESTED**: 2+ users × 3 days
- **VERIFIED**: 10+ users × 7 days

If you test a playbook, include:
- Duration (days)
- What you did (brief)
- Results (measurable or observed)

---

## Skill Links (Important)
Only add **real downloadable skills** with:
- Direct link to the skill
- Repo link (if separate)
- One‑line description of what it does

Do **not** add placeholder or search links as verified skills.

## Style Guidelines
- Write for humans, not machines
- Keep steps short and actionable
- Avoid jargon unless defined
- Prefer real examples over theory
