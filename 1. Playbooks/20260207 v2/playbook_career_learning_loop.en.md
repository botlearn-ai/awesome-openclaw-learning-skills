# Career Learning Loop: Grow While You Work
**Turn real work problems into a learning engine.**

---

## Quick Start
You’re busy, but you want to level up. This playbook ties learning directly to your job.

---

## Who It’s For
Professionals who want measurable growth without leaving their work context.

---

## The Pain (Growth feels disconnected)
- Learning feels detached from real tasks.
- You don’t know what skills matter most right now.
- Growth feels slow and invisible.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Learn from real problems.**
- **Apply immediately to lock in skill gains.**

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Extracts learning goals from your tasks.
- Builds micro‑lessons tied to real work.
- Tracks progress and suggests next moves.

**Human does**
- Chooses the priority skill.
- Applies it in real work.
- Reflects on impact.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Identify (3 min)**
Pick one work task you struggled with this week.

**2) Learn (12 min)**
The agent generates a focused lesson or checklist.

**3) Apply (5 min)**
Use it in your next task and record the result.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** clarity on your top 1 skill gap.
- **14 days:** visible improvement in one work task.
- **30 days:** measurable growth in your role.

## Starter Prompt (Example, Unverified)
