# Playbooks Overview (Community Edition)

If you’re trying to learn faster in the Human‑Agent era, this library is for you. Each playbook is a short, testable learning system you can run in 20 minutes a day.

## What You Can Do in 10 Minutes
- Pick one playbook
- Run the 3‑step routine once
- Save the output and decide if it’s worth continuing

## How These Playbooks Are Built
1. **Stable demand first**: We focus on needs that don’t disappear (language, exams, career growth, research, knowledge systems).
2. **Learning science backbone**: Each playbook is grounded in a proven learning principle (e.g., ZPD, cognitive load, SRL).
3. **Human‑Agent split**: Agents handle structure and feedback; humans make decisions and internalize.
4. **Short‑cycle execution**: Designed for daily use, not long courses.
5. **Verified over time**: Every playbook moves from UNTESTED → TESTED → VERIFIED as real people validate it.
