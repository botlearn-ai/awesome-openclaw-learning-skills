# Technical Interview Training: Practice Like It’s Real
**Short, sharp simulations that build real interview confidence.**

---

## Quick Start
You can solve problems alone, but interviews feel different. This playbook makes practice realistic.

---

## Who It’s For
Candidates preparing for technical interviews in software, data, or product roles.

---

## The Pain (Pressure breaks performance)
- You blank out under time pressure.
- You don’t know how to explain your thinking.
- Practice doesn’t feel realistic.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Simulate the real environment.**
- **Explain out loud to improve clarity and speed.**

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Generates interview‑style questions.
- Times you and gives feedback.
- Evaluates explanation quality.

**Human does**
- Solves and explains out loud.
- Reflects on mistakes.
- Refines approach.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Question (3 min)**
Pick one question at the right difficulty level.

**2) Solve (12 min)**
Solve it while speaking your reasoning out loud.

**3) Review (5 min)**
Fix the one biggest mistake and write a better explanation.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** faster reasoning under time pressure.
- **14 days:** clearer explanations.
- **30 days:** stable interview performance.

---

## Starter Prompt (Example, Unverified)
Use this once to generate today’s workflow:

```
Give me one medium‑level coding interview question.
I will explain my solution; then score clarity (1‑5) and list 2 improvements.
```
