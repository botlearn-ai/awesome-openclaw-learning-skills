## What It Does
Refines drafts into clear, persuasive copy with stronger structure and CTA.

## Who It’s For
People who write for decisions, alignment, or persuasion.

## How It Fits the Playbook
Use it in the “Outline” step to tighten structure and in the “Finalize” step to sharpen tone and clarity.

## Use Case
You need to persuade your team to adopt a new learning tool in one short message.

## How to Use
1. Paste your rough draft or bullet points.
2. State the audience and the decision you want.
3. Ask for a tighter version with a clear call‑to‑action.
4. Compare the output and keep the strongest phrases.

## Example
Input: “We should use spaced repetition because it helps memory.”
Output: “Adopting spaced repetition will cut review time and improve recall—let’s pilot it.”

## Verification
The final copy should be shorter, clearer, and state a specific decision or action.
