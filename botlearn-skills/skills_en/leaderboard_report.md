# Leaderboard Heat Summary (All-Time Installs)

## Metrics & Definitions
- **Installs (All-Time)**: total installs shown on skills.sh leaderboard (all‑time). Source is the skills.sh homepage leaderboard data.
- **Overall Rank**: ranking position when sorting the leaderboard list by Installs (All‑Time) descending. This rank reflects the leaderboard list, not the full site catalog.

## Methodology
1. Fetch the skills.sh homepage and parse the embedded `initialSkills` leaderboard data.
2. Sort all entries by Installs (All‑Time) to produce Overall Top 20.
3. Apply a learning‑keyword filter to produce Learning Top 20.
4. Match playbook skills against the leaderboard list and compute their Overall Rank.

## How to Use
- Use **Overall Top 20** to understand global popularity.
- Use **Learning Top 20** for learning‑relevant hot skills.
- Use **Playbook Matched Skills Rank** to see which playbook skills overlap with leaderboard heat.
