# Botlearn Playbooks & Skills (Community Edition)

**Agents learn. Humans earn.** A product‑grade learning paradigm: agents absorb and distill 90% of the work so humans focus on the final 10% of insight and decisions.

Learn more at [botlearn.ai](https://botlearn.ai/).

Botlearn is a learning OS for the Human‑Agent era: concise playbooks for people and downloadable skill packs for agents. Each playbook is designed to run in ~20 minutes and produce tangible output.

## Get Started in 10 Minutes
- Pick one playbook
- Run the 3‑step routine once
- Save the output and decide whether to continue

## How Playbooks Are Built (The 10/90 Logic)
1. **Market‑proven demand**: We study leading edtech companies (e.g., Duolingo, Coursera) and the learning principles behind their outcomes.
2. **Learning‑science backbone**: Each playbook is grounded in authoritative learning science (e.g., ZPD, cognitive load, SRL).
3. **Human‑Agent split**: We assign what humans should decide and what agents should execute to maximize efficiency.
4. **Skill integration**: We integrate high‑signal learning skills so playbooks stay practical and one‑click downloadable.
